# Decision review ledger (D-206)

> Read [`docs/BRIEF.md`](../BRIEF.md) first. Every CEO session starts by re-rating our decisions against the goal and appends one dated section here (D-206). The goal (D-010, D-026): skipwait.me is the go-to global site for job referrals and gets people referred faster. Seekers and referrers both win, the business earns, and nobody's money is at risk.

## How a session uses this file
1. Start from the newest section below. Re-rate:
   - every register entry newer than that section;
   - every decision the top five open tasks in `docs/plans/assignments.json` rest on;
   - the next 20 active entries that have gone longest without a review (the "Cursor" line of the newest section).
2. Rate each one 1 to 10 against the goal, with the evidence. Give each a status: active, superseded or historical.
3. For anything below 10, choose one of three outcomes:
   - **CEO remit (D-203):** fine-tune it now, as a new register entry with `Affects tasks:`, and re-sync those tasks (D-202).
   - **Owner-reserved (D-123):** put it to the owner, rated, with the strongest counter-argument (D-023).
   - **Missing evidence:** name the cheapest test that would settle it, and queue it.
4. Append a section: the date, the session, the ids reviewed with ratings, the actions taken (with D-numbers), the owner questions, and the new Cursor.

## Sessions

### 2026-10-26, Claude Code (decision audit, D-218)
- **Scope:** all 193 register rows checked for propagation (which newer entry changed each one), 145 suspected unnamed conflicts and 58 changes to owner-reserved rules by non-owner rulings; evidence in [`DECISION-AUDIT-oct26.md`](DECISION-AUDIT-oct26.md). Status set for 86 older rows (section 3 there). This session did **not** rate every entry 1 to 10; it rated only the ones it touched.
- **Ratings (against the goal: the go-to global site for job referrals, getting people referred faster):**
  - **D-216, 8/10.** One clear priced model replaces three half-shipped ones. The free 3 at any level with a verified card keeps the door open while cutting spam. Against: the job-level to band mapping, the paid-priority routing and the USD renewal rail are open, so nothing sells until they close.
  - **D-217, 8/10.** A day-long poster window moves requests faster than 48 h without losing the poster's edge. Against: no data yet on poster response times.
  - **D-147, 6/10 as written.** "Any decline keeps it spent" is clear, but runtime treats a pass without a claim differently from a pass after one, and D-066 (2) still releases on a step back. Its scope is the open question in the audit's section 8 (a).
  - **D-066 (2), 5/10 until that question is settled.**
  - **D-174, 7/10.** "Never expires" is user-kind, but removal waits on the reconfirm switch (D-193), so the old clocks still run.
  - **D-176, 8/10.** Matches how seekers search. Seven strings still contradict it; DECISION-COPY-oct26 owns them.
  - **D-196, 7/10.** Paid referrer priority could serve both sides. It now has prices (D-216 (7)) but no reviewed routing.
- **Actions:**
  - Recorded D-216 (the Oct 25 pricing freeze, re-confirmed by the owner Oct 26) and D-217 (24 h poster first match), and D-218 for this audit.
  - Set 86 status notes and synced PRICING, AGENTS, BRIEF, PRD and plans/README.
  - Moved D-132-item3, D-132-v2-checkout and SKIPPY-3 to architect, made D-132-item3's re-scope deliver the accepted-price check SKIPPY-fix needs first, and made D-048-p3-skippy wait for SKIPPY-fix.
  - Added rows DECISION-COPY-oct26 and DECISION-SYNC-oct26.
- **Owner questions:** the six in section 8 of the audit. Evidence for (a) the D-147 scope, (b) the invite-reward scope and (c) the first-look timing is pending from Instinct on PR #666.
- **Cursor:** next session rates D-001 to D-020 (oldest first; none of them was rated here), then every entry newer than D-218.
